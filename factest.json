The stock corral is within walking distance of the small but scenic Summit Lake and seven miles from the trailhead to Lassen Peak, the largest volcano in the park (elevation 10,457 ft.).<br/><br/>\nRiders will find one of the park's major trails only 1/4 mile away from the stock corral. A convenient horse trail leads to the Summit Lake Ranger Station where the trailhead is located.  Many more trails are in close proximity with access to Juniper Lake, Snag Lake, and Butte Lake.  The Pacific Crest Trail, which runs through the park, is also accessible from the Summit Lake Stock Corral.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Summit Lake area is a hub for hiking and horse riding enthusiasts.  Many of the park's 150 miles of trails can be accessed from this area.  Located a short distance from the stock corral is the Cluster Lakes loop trail, a major trailhead into the park's interior, bypassing several alpine lakes and popular among birders.  Evening programs are presented at an amphitheater within the Summit Lake Campground area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe facility has two metal stock corrals with water troughs and water is furnished for the horses.  There is no potable water so campers must bring their own water or go into the Summit Lake Campground to obtain drinking water.  There are two campsites with tables, fire rings and bear lockers available.  There is a vault toilet available near the site for the use of campers at the stock corral.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe national park is known for its volcanic history, as well as its diversity of plants and animals.  It contains 300 active volcanic domes and many hydrothermal features, such as mud pots and steam vents.  Lassen Peak is the southernmost active volcano in the Cascades, and the second most recent volcano to erupt in the lower 48 of the United States before Mount Saint Helens.<br/><br/>\nLassen Volcanic National Park boasts over 700 species of flowering plants and 250 native species including birds, mammals, reptiles and fish.  The park is at the junction of the Cascade Mountains, the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Great Basin, providing many unique habitats.","FacilityDirections":"From Redding, California, take State Highway 44 east approximately 48 miles to the Manzanita Lake entrance of the park.  The stock corral is 14 miles south of the entrance on the main park road.  Upon reaching the Summit Lake Ranger Station continue approximately 1/8 mile to a \"Service Road\" turning off on the right.  Turn right and continue up the road taking the first fork to the right which continues up the hill to the campsite and the stock corrals.","FacilityEmail":"Michelle_DUlisse@nps.gov","FacilityID":"233358","FacilityLatitude":40.4944444,"FacilityLongitude":-121.4175,"FacilityMapURL":"","FacilityName":"SUMMIT LAKE STOCK

It has two Congressionally-designated National Wild and Scenic sections: the Wild & Scenic Upper Rogue River and the Wild & Scenic Lower Rogue River! The 84-mile long Wild & Scenic Lower Rogue River was one of the original rivers designated under the <a href=\"https://www.rivers.gov/wsr-act.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wild & Scenic Rivers Act of 1968</a>, and carries that title from the mouth of the Applegate River to the Lobster Creek Bridge.</p><p><br/>Designated for Outstandingly Remarkable Values that include Scenery, Recreation, and Fish, steelhead and salmon fishery, challenging whitewater, and extraordinary wildlife viewing opportunities have all made the Lower Rogue a national treasure. The Lower Rogue River is home to abundant species of wildlife, including black bear, river otter and Chinook salmon. Popular activities include whitewater rafting, fishing, <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/?cid=FSEPRD582239\" rel=\"nofollow\">kayaking, jet boat tours, stand-up paddle boarding</a>, hiking and backpacking, and swimming.</p><p>The Wild Section of the Lower Rogue River is one of the most popular whitewater runs in the world, with <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/?cid=FSEPRD581495\" rel=\"nofollow\">permitted outfitters and guides</a> taking visitors downriver throughout the summer and fall season. Unique among boating experiences, groups may float from lodge to lodge in sections of the Rogue, or camp along the banks for the full wilderness experience.  For the wild section, the most remote and challenging whitewater, <strong>competitively allocated float permits are required from May 15 - October 15</strong>.

visitors have scaled the rugged cliffs using the stairwell from the Landing Cove, they will be rewarded with a campground perched on the bluffs with magnificent coastal views.\n\n</p><p>Anacapa Island, the closest Channel Island to the mainland of California, is comprised of three islets (appropriately named East, Middle, and West Anacapa Islands). Waves have eroded the volcanic island, creating towering sea cliffs, sea caves, and natural bridges, such as forty-foot-high Arch Rock -- a symbol of Anacapa and Channel Islands National Park.\n\n</p><p>Exploring East Anacapa's two-mile trail system allows visitors to experience the island's native vegetation, wildlife, and cultural history. The islands' native vegetation is recovering slowly with the help of the National Park Service's restoration efforts. This recovery, along with the removal of nonnative predators, has aided in the reestablishment of nesting land birds and seabirds. The island is one of the most important seabird nesting sites within the Channel Islands.  While the steep cliffs of West Anacapa are home to the largest breeding colony of endangered California brown pelicans, all the islets of Anacapa host the largest breeding colony of western gulls in the world.\n\n</p><p>The rocky shores of Anacapa are perfect resting and breeding areas for California sea lions and harbor seals. Anacapa's rich kelp forests (ideal for kayaking, snorkeling, and diving) and tidepool areas provide visitors with the opportunity to meet some of the resident ocean animals up close.\n\n</p><p>Anacapa Island has a rich human history as well. Shell midden sites indicate where Chumash people camped on the islands thousands of years ago. In addition, visitors can view the 1932 light station. The original lead-crystal Fresnel lens, which served as a beacon to ships until an automated light replaced it in 1990, is on exhibit in the East Anacapa Visitor Center.</p><h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>With two miles of hiking trails, ocean access nearby the campground, and generally good weather, Anacapa Island offers a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, swimming, snorkeling, diving, kayaking and wildlife/wildflower viewing. In summer, rangers lead an underwater video program. The program includes live video footage of sea life which is projected for visitors to see. It's a great way to stay dry while viewing colorful sea creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Since Anacapa Island is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. There are no services on the island, so all gear has to be brought to the island. For more information about recreational activities in the park, visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/index.htm. </a></p><h2>Facilities</h2>\nA half mile hike, including 154 steps, is needed to get from the Landing Cove to the seven-site (4-6 persons per site) campground. Camping is primitive and campers must bring their own food, equipment and water. Picnic table, food storage box, and pit toilet are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nWaves have eroded the 5-mile volcanic island, creating steep, towering sea cliffs, sea caves and natural bridges. Much of the year, the island vegetation looks brown, but the winter rain brings brightly-colored terrain. The altitude is low and ranges from sea level to 250 feet.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Landing Cove near the campground is an ideal place for swimming, diving, snorkeling and kayaking, but there are no lifeguards on the island. The island is also home to just over two miles of trails that meander to dramatic overlooks and magnificent coastal views. All hikers must stay on the trails for visitor safety and to protect fragile vegetation and nesting seabirds. No off- trail hiking is allowed.","FacilityDirections":"<p>Boat transportation can be arranged with Island Packers from Ventura or Channel Islands (Oxnard) Harbors.</p>\n\n<p>To park headquarters in Ventura, California: Highway 101, exit Victoria or Seaward to Ventura Harbor.</p>","FacilityEmail":"","FacilityID":"232502","FacilityLatitude":34.0141917,"FacilityLongitude":-119.3677889,"FacilityMapURL":"","FacilityName":"ANACAPA ISLAND","FacilityPhone":"805-658-5730","FacilityReservationURL":"","FacilityTypeDescription":"Campground","FacilityUseFeeDescription":"","GEOJSON":{"COORDINATES":[-119.3677889,34.0141917],"TYPE":"Point"},"Keywords":"CG06,Anacapa Island,Channel Islands National Park,Channel Island,Anacapa,Channel Islands","LINK":[{"Description":"California State Road Conditions","EntityID":"232502","EntityLinkID":"b3373b6651c3fc9419f8bd4d6397ec76","EntityType":"Facility","LinkType":"Other","Title":"California State Road Conditions","URL":"http://www.dot.ca.gov"},{"Description":"California State Tourism","EntityID":"232502","EntityLinkID":"405c488ad243334b08ff0fe1f43e6815","EntityType":"Facility","LinkType":"Other","Title":"California State Tourism","URL":"http://gocalif.ca.gov/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home"},{"Description":"Island Packers Boat Trips","EntityID":"232502","EntityLinkID":"5fa7913f6cbf31305dc6a127f539859b","EntityType":"Facility","LinkType":"Other","Title":"National Park Services Concessionaire","URL":"http://islandpackers.com/"}],"LastUpdatedDate":"2026-02-05","LegacyFacilityID":"70984","MEDIA":[{"Credits":"Tim Hauf, timhaufphotography.com","Description":"Inspiration Point, Anacapa Island","EmbedCode":"","EntityID":"232502","EntityMediaID":"a76e30d7-2143-46b6-9334-b26c4ceea128","EntityType":"Facility","Height":525,"IsGallery":false,"IsPreview":true,"IsPrimary":false,"MediaType":"Image","Subtitle":"","Title":"Yellow flowered plant on ocean bluff overlooking three islets and the surrounding ocean.","URL":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/08/07/00/58/e6c6707e-de31-4ec7-b810-fca92d92e94a_700.webp","Width":700},{"Credits":"Tim Hauf, timhaufphotography.com","Description":"Campground, Anacapa Island","EmbedCode":"","EntityID":"232502","EntityMediaID":"442e3e67-74d0-40ed-918a-962d18cce967","EntityType":"Facility","Height":778,"IsGallery":true,"IsPreview":false,"IsPrimary":false,"MediaType":"Image","Subtitle":"","Title":"Coastal terrace with two tents, two buildings and lighthouse in the distance.

visitors have scaled the rugged cliffs using the steep trail from the Landing Cove, they will be rewarded with a campground perched on the bluffs with magnificent coastal views.\n\n</p><p>Santa Barbara lies much further south than the other four northern Channel Islands and is the smallest, measuring just one square mile. The islands' native vegetation is recovering slowly with the help of the National Park Service's restoration efforts. This recovery, along with the removal of nonnative predators, has aided in the reestablishment of nesting land birds and seabirds. The island is one of the most important seabird nesting sites within the Channel Islands, with 11 nesting species, including western gulls, California brown pelicans, three species of cormorants, three species of storm-petrels, and one of the world's largest colonies of Scripps's murrelets. The rocky shores of Santa Barbara Island also provide resting and breeding areas for California sea lions, harbor seals and northern elephant seals.\n</p><h2>Recreation</h2>\nWith five miles of hiking trails, ocean access nearby the campground and generally good weather, Santa Barbara Island offers a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, swimming, snorkeling, diving, kayaking and wildlife/wildflower viewing. Since Santa Barbara Island is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. There are no services on the island, so all gear has to be brought to the island. For more information about recreational activities in the park, visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/index.htm</a>.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nSanta Barbara Island Campground offers 10 campsites (4 persons per site). Camping is primitive and campers must bring their own food, equipment and water. Picnic table, food storage box and pit toilet are provided. Distance from landing to campground is a quarter-mile and includes a 200-foot climb. Access to the island is by Island Packers Cruises or by private boat. Due to the Island Packer boat schedule, minimum stay is generally three days.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nSteep cliffs on this small island rise above rocky shores and give way to a grassy mesa flanked with twin peaks. The highest point, Signal Peak, is 635 feet in elevation.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>The Landing Cove near the campground is an ideal place for swimming, diving, snorkeling and kayaking, but there are no lifeguards on the island. \n\n</p><p>The island is also home to just over five miles of trails that meander over gentle slopes and low mountain tops to dramatic overlooks and magnificent coastal views. All hikers must stay on the trails for visitor safety and to protect fragile vegetation and nesting seabirds. No off-trail hiking is allowed. Portions of trails are subject to closure when pelicans are nesting from January through August.</p>","FacilityDirections":"Boat transportation can be arranged with Island Packers from Ventura

This is a lovely stream that is perfect for swimming in the early summer when the main Merced is too high. Springtime comes early around here (late February — April) and the wildflowers on the slopes of the North Fork Merced can be spectacular. There is a beautiful cascade about 3/4 of a mile upstream from the confluence that makes a great destination for a cool dip on a hot day.</p>\n\n<p>Although most people explore the North Fork as a day outing, it makes a great short or introductory backpacking adventure. The North Fork Merced is approximately a one-hour (2.5 mile) walk from the Railroad Flat campground along the old Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade (also known as the Merced River Trail). Access is by trail or river only. Bring plenty of water or, better yet, pack a water filter.</p>\n\n<h3>Permits, Fees and Limitations:</h3>\n\n<p>Campfire permits are required for all fires. Fire restrictions that prohibit all fires go into effect each summer (exact dates unknown). Please check for current conditions at: <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/public-safety-and-fire/fire-and-aviation/regional-info/california/fire-restrictions\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLM California Fire Restrictions webpage. </a> No overnight permit is required. Please follow Leave No Trace practices. Pack it in, pack it out. No glass bottles allowed within 1/4 mile of the Merced River.</p>\n\n<p>Please Note: The old Yosemite railroad grade is accessible by vehicles up to the Railroad Flat Campground. Only equestrian, pedestrians, and bicycles are permitted beyond the Railroad Flat Campground.</p>\n\n<h3>Helpful Links:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>River flow is posted on-line at: <a href=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.225.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dreamflows.com</a></li>\n\t<li>Back To: <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/merced-river\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merced River Recreation Management Area</a></li>\n\t<li>Visit: <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/briceburg-visitor-center\" rel=\"nofollow\">Briceburg Visitor Center</a></li>\n\t<li>Return To: <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/office/mother-lode-field-office\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLM, Mother Lode Field Office</a></li>\n</ul>\n","FacilityDirections":"<p>The North Fork Merced is located seven (7) miles downstream from the Briceburg Visitor Center where it joins the Merced Wild & Scenic River.

The site is situated in the heart of Yosemite Valley, an awe-inspiring landscape containing many of the famous features for which Yosemite National Park is known. Within Yosemite, visitors gaze upon waterfalls, sheer granite cliffs, deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, vast wilderness areas and much more. <a href=\"https://recreationonestopprod.servicenowservices.com/external?id=kb_article&sys_id=72fff607dbe8a30022f970c08c961990&table=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yosemite National Park Campground Reservation Dates</a> </p><p>For additional park information, call (209) 372-0200 or visit <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nps.gov/yose</a>  </p><h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Yosemite's trails, cliffs, roads and rivers provide endless recreational activities for any kind of visitor. Hiking, biking, rock climbing, fishing, horseback riding, rafting, auto touring and photography are all very popular activities within the park. <br><br><br>Hiking trails range from the easy, paved, two-mile round-trip walk to Mirror Lake/Meadow, to the grueling but rewarding 14- to 16-mile trek to Half Dome (advanced permit required). Both of these trails begin near the Pines Campgrounds, and there are many additional trailheads within Yosemite Valley.<br><br> Rafting the Merced River is a fun way to cool down on a summer day when water levels are sufficient. Yosemite Valley also offers numerous guided bus tours, educational programs, museums, ranger-led activities,and an art center with workshops.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Lower Pines Campground is one of the three reservation campgrounds in Yosemite Valley. It offers paved roads and parking spurs, flush toilets, drinking water, and an amphitheater. Each campsite contains a picnic table, fire ring, and a food storage locker.  <br> <br>Yosemite's free shuttle bus stops at the campground entrance. Within walking distance, historic Curry Village offers showers (for a fee), a general store, restaurants and a bar, amphitheater, and tours and activities desk.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nYosemite Valley is forested with a diverse mix of California black oak, ponderosa pine, incense-cedar, white fir and whiteleaf manzanita, which offers a pleasant combination of sun and shade. Through the trees, Yosemite's telltale granite cliffs peek through, and the gentle, refreshing Merced River flows nearby.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nGlacier Point offers sweeping views of Yosemite Valley, Little Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, Vernal and Nevada Falls, and Clouds Rest, among other notable landmarks and a visit to Wawona and the Pioneer Yosemite History Center is like stepping back in time. <br/><br/>\nThe Tioga Road offers a 39-mile scenic drive past forests, meadows, lakes, and granite domes. Tuolumne Meadows embodies the high-country of the Sierra Nevada, with its broad sub-alpine meadows and granite domes and peaks and the beautiful Hetch Hetchy Reservoir is home to spectacular scenery and numerous wilderness trailheads.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\nCancellations more than 48 hours in advance of arrival date only incur a $10 transaction fee.  Within 48 hours, $10 and the first night's fee are charged (Exception: 1 night reservations do not incur an additional $10 fee, but do not receive a refund).  No-shows will be assessed a $20 service fee along with the loss of the first night's fee.

Minersville is one of the more popular campgrounds on Trinity Lake due to its easy access to the lake and scenic views. At 2,400 foot elevation, it is nestled in a stand of mixed conifers and deciduous trees. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrinity Lake is one of three Forest Service-managed lakes in the Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area, offering excellent opportunities for houseboating, water skiing, tubing and wakeboarding.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe area offers excellent opportunities for fishing, kayaking, hiking and wildlife viewing. Directly adjacent to the campground is the Minersville Boat Ramp. Informal mooring of boats is possible off some of the campsites.<br/><br/> \n\nRainbow trout are abundant, and brown and brook trout are common. This is a good lake for a float tube and excellent fly fishing.<br/><br/>\n\nThe area offers wonderful wildlife viewing opportunities. Hikers can access the 4-mile Trinity Lakeshore Trail at nearby Clark Springs Campground.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe first section of the campground is well-developed with paved, level parking aprons and amenities. The second section is mostly walk-in with good privacy between campsites, and more primitive with a wilderness feel.  \n \nThere are six walk-in campsites (four single, two double). In addition, there are two accessible campsites 8 & 4 . Sites have picnic tables and campfire rings with grills.  \n\nTwo flush toilets and one vault toilet are available.
